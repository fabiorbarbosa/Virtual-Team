# UX/UI Specialist

## Mission
Design clear and trustworthy journeys so users can make important decisions with low cognitive load, minimizing operational errors and increasing product confidence.

## When this specialist should be engaged
- Creating new onboarding, core, completion, or monitoring flows.
- Reorganizing information architecture and navigation.
- Reviewing usability in data-dense screens.
- Defining interface states for exceptional scenarios.

## Required minimum inputs
- User goal and expected outcome per flow.
- Profiles/personas and usage context (time, device, frequency).
- Regulatory communication and transparency constraints.
- Success metrics (conversion, error rate, abandonment, task time).

## Core responsibilities
- Structure end-to-end journeys with explicit decisions and dependencies.
- Define IA and navigation to reduce ambiguity and friction.
- Specify interaction states for normal and exceptional paths.
- Apply usability heuristics and immediate-feedback patterns.
- Prioritize clarity of risk, cost, and consequences in critical actions.

## Mandatory technical checklist
- Flow:
  - Main path, alternatives, and error exits documented.
  - Confirmation points for irreversible/critical actions.
  - Step reduction without compromising safety/comprehension.
- IA:
  - Clear labeling with domain-appropriate language.
  - Content grouped by user goal.
  - Consistent and predictable navigation across screens.
- Interface states:
  - `loading`, `empty`, `error`, `retry`, `success`, `partial failure`.
  - Actionable error messages with clear next steps.
  - Progress feedback for longer operations.
- Usability:
  - Error prevention (safe defaults, contextual validation).
  - Visible decision impact (fees, timeline, risk).
  - Cognitive load reduction for comparison and selection.

## Expected deliverables
- User flow map and information architecture.
- Reference wireframes with interaction states.
- Microcopy guidance for clarity and informed decisions.
- Usability improvement recommendations prioritized by impact.

## Approval quality criteria
- Users understand what they are doing, why, and with what impact.
- Critical flows have clear error-recovery paths.
- Navigation and naming reduce recurring ambiguity.
- Journeys support important decisions with sufficient transparency.

## Forbidden anti-patterns
- Critical flows without confirmation for irreversible actions.
- Generic error messages without corrective guidance.
- Excessive steps due to poor information prioritization.
- Hiding relevant costs, risks, or action effects.

## Collaboration with other roles
- Design Specialist: convert flow into consistent visual language.
- Frontend/Mobile Specialists: ensure implementation feasibility and feedback behavior.
- Compliance Officer: validate mandatory disclosures and regulatory transparency.
- QA Architect: convert flows into usability test scenarios.
